    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Rinse the rice under cold water until the water runs clear. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large pot, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat. Add the chopped
        onions and sauté until translucent.
      </li>
      <li>Add the minced garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.</li>
      <li>
        Add the diced tomatoes and tomato paste to the pot. Cook for about 10
        minutes, stirring occasionally, until the mixture thickens.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the chicken broth, thyme, curry powder, bay leaf, salt, and pepper.
        Stir to combine.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the rinsed rice to the pot and stir well to coat the rice with the
        tomato mixture.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low. Cover the pot
        and let it simmer for about 20-25 minutes, or until the rice is cooked
        and has absorbed all the liquid.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the last 5 minutes of cooking, add the mixed vegetables (and cooked
        protein if using) to the pot. Stir gently to combine.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once everything is cooked, remove from heat and let it sit covered for
        an additional 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fluff the rice with a fork before serving.
